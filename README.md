# project_pivot

Project Pivot is a start-to-finish software development project. Encompassing the full lifecycle of a product from planning and design, through to implementation and distribution. The first product will be Pivot Backup, an automated backup tool, in script and GUI version. This product will then be hosted on a purpose built local webserver, on a custom made website, distributing the product for free download.
This will allow me to learn, develop and showcase my skills for future employment opportunities.

- Pivot Backup built with Python - Completed
- GUI design and implementation - Completed
- Local hosting on an Ubuntu server - In Progress
- Website developed and deployed locally
- AWS serverless website deployment

This includes design documents for every major iteration of the program, the configuration of the local hosting setup and eventually a full dump of the website. 
I have also included documents such as installation documents, .exe files of the programs, my approach to version control and the overall objective of the project.
