# project_pivot

Project Pivot is a start-to-finish tech project. Encompassing the full lifecycle of a product from planning and design, through to implementation and distribution. The first product will be Pivot Backup, an automated backup tool, in script and GUI version. This product will then be hosted on a purpose built local webserver, on a custom made website, distributing the product for free download.
This will allow me to learn, develop and showcase my skills for future employment opportunities.
